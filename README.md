# Life in Weeks for Obsidian

Create a Life in Weeks note that displays a grid of weeks, and add events to those weeks!

Inspired by [Buster Benson's Life in Weeks](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks), and the idea is from [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

2. At the end of your Markdown file, add the (empty) configuration (you can then use the 'Open configuration' button to set the values):
